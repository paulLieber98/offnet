# Numbers and Operations

In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of numbers and basic mathematical operations.

## Topics Covered:
1. Natural Numbers
2. Integer Operations
3. Basic Arithmetic
4. Order of Operations

## Key Concepts

### Natural Numbers
Natural numbers are the counting numbers we use every day: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

### Integer Operations
Learn how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers (positive and negative whole numbers).

### Basic Arithmetic
Master the four fundamental operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (ร)
- Division (รท)

### Order of Operations
Remember PEMDAS:
1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

# Fractions and Decimals

Understanding how to work with parts of whole numbers.

## Topics Covered:
1. What are Fractions?
2. Converting Fractions to Decimals
3. Basic Operations with Fractions
4. Real-world Applications

## Key Concepts

### Fractions
A fraction represents a part of a whole, written as a/b where:
- a is the numerator
- b is the denominator

### Decimal Numbers
Decimals are another way to represent parts of whole numbers using place values.

### Converting Between Forms
Learn how to convert:
- Fractions to decimals
- Decimals to fractions
- Mixed numbers to improper fractions
